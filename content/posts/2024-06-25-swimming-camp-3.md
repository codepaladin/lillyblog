YESSSSSS, I finally touched the bottom of the  12 1/2 foot pool!!! 

I dashed onto the diving board and bounced 3 to 5 times to be exact. And once I felt I was ready, I pencil dived right into the pool! Once I was close to the ground, I put my arms up to give myself a boost, and boom, I touched the bottom, bent my legs, and shot myself up to the surface of the pool! That was one of the best achievement of my life!
